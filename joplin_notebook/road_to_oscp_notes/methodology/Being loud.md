Being loud

In a pentest it seems to be that you want to be as loud over the network within reason as possible. The reason for this is your trying to pen a client and them seeing you and saying that they see you is part of the test. Even if they have to tell you to tone it down a bit that is a good thing. It means the blue team is doing their job right.

1. Be loud
2. Let blue team catch you in the act
3. Report what blue team caught you doing
4. Report what blue team then did not see you doing

This will only improve the system and proccess
