1.  Find the Cider note of your network (ex that of a **/24**)
2.  Correspond that too the proper subnet (ex: Subnet (25-32) has 255.255.x.0)
3.  Replace x with the column it aligns with, /24 aligns with 255 in the top right

Gotcha: For the total number of hosts available always subtract 2, for exampleÂ  256 has 254 Ip's available
