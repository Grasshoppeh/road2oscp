# Analysis

As part of the class I'm taking they want us to analyze the file from the given information on our own before moving on.

**Port 22 (SSH**

- SSH Version 2.9p2 (protocol 1.99) (Version or protocol may have different exploits look at them individually?)
- Public Keys (maybe crackable, I know what I don't know and I'm making a guess here)

```
1024 b8:74:6c:db:fd:8b:e6:66:e9:2a:2b:df:5e:6f:64:86 (RSA1)
1024 8f:8e:5b:81:ed:21:ab:c1:80:e1:57:a3:3c:85:c4:71 (DSA)
1024 ed:4e:a9:4a:06:14:ff:15:14:ce:da:3a:80:db:e2:81 (RSA)
```

- Server supports SSHv1, maybe this can be abused?

**Port 80** (Apache) (I don't know a lot about this, need to research)

- Apache version httpd 1.3.20 (Check this version, may have an exploit
- mod_ssl/2.8.4 OpenSSL/0.9.6b (Check the version, may be vulnerable)
- `Potentially risky methods: TRACE`, I don't know what this means, sounds intresting though. Google it

**Port 111** rpcbind

- Not too sure what this port does, need to research
- Not sure about `rpcbind 2 (RPC #100000)` at this time, need to research
- sweet, thanks for telling me about another open port

```
|   100000  2            111/tcp   rpcbind
|   100000  2            111/udp   rpcbind
|   100024  1          32768/tcp   status
|_  100024  1          32768/udp   status
```

**port 139** (samba)

- Samba is a file mounting service, `netbios-ssn Samba smbd (workgroup: SMYGROUP)`, not sure how I can abuse ths info yet, but ti give my the group name of the share.

**port 443** (https)

- I'm not sure, but this seems out of place??? `http-title: 400 Bad Request`. Even as a regular IT a request like nmap should generally not give back an error. Worth investigating.
- "Don't worry, we will contact you, we know where you live." -Some government spy agency `ssl-cert: Subject: commonName=localhost.localdomain/organizationName=SomeOrganization/stateOrProvinceName=SomeState/countryName=--`
- Certificate is expired, if I was on your IT team I would be unhappy right now. Can this be abused, malicous cert or getting inbetween? >:(

Not valid after:  2010-09-26T09:32:06
```

- Not sure I don't know what I can use this for or how to act on it, need to know more.

```

**Port 32768**

- something is on this port and it is related to port 111 I think, good possibility this is an entry point `32768/tcp open status 1 (RPC #100024)`

**General inferances from given info**

- **OS:** Probably Redhat / CentOS
- **OS Version**: 2.4.X (2.4.9 - 2.4.18) with high certainty
    - If the software is old and we did not pass through a IDS they probably did not see us because of a Syn, Syn-ack, Rst
- SMB running, `smb2-time: Protocol negotiation failed (SMB2)`
