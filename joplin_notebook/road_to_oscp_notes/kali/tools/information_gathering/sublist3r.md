# Hunting for subdomains

You need to search for sub-domains when testing. If you are not you will be limiting yourself to missing tons of information about the potential target.
EX: if you did not search for subdomains you check telsa.com, but missing vpn.tesla.com

## To install
```
apt install sublist3r
```

# usage

```
sublist3r -d <domain>
```
