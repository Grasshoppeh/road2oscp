Google Fu

# Good ole google searching

You can use domain searches on your target to find senstive information sometimes

```
site:<domain> -www -<something you don't want> filetype<csv,docx,pdf,odt,xlsx,etc>
```
Sometimes a little bit of hunting on a domain you can find intresting stuff

Gotcha: do not add www unless you want to search that specficlly, this will allow you to search subdomains
